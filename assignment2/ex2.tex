\section{Bottom-$k$ sampling}

\subsection{Exercise 2}

\subsection{Exercise 3(a)}
We would store the buttom-$k$ samples in a minimum heap structure $H$, sorted by
their hashing value. This way we can insert new entries in $O(\text{lg } n)$,
and retrieve the $S^{k}_{h}(H)$ lowest hash values in $O(k \text{ lg } n)$ where
$n$ is the total number of input values.

\subsection{Exercise 3(b)}
As written above we would be able to process/insert the next key in $O(\text{lg
} n)$ time.
