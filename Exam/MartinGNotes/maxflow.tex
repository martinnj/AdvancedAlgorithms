\section{Max-flow: Notes}
%%
A flow network $G = (V,E)$ is a directed graph where each edge $(u,v) \in E$ has
a non-negative capacity $c(u,v) \geq 0$. If there is an edge $(u,v) \in E$ then
there is no edge $(v,u) \in E$. If $(u,v) \notin E$ then $c(u,v) = 0$ for convenience.
When $(u,v) \notin E$, $f(u,v) = 0$.

Flow networks have a source $s$ and a sink $t$. For each vertex $v \in V$, the flow
network contains a path $s \leadsto v \leadsto t$. The graph is therefore connected, meaning
$|E| \geq |V| - 1$.

A flow is a real-valued function $f : V \times V \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ that satisfies
two properties:
%%
\begin{description}
	\item[Capacity constraint:] For all $u,v \in V$, $0 \leq f(u,v) \leq c(u,v)$

	\item[Flow conservation:] For all $u \in V - \{s,t\}$, 
	$\sum_{v \in V} f(u,v) = \sum_{v \in V} f(v,u)$.
\end{description}
%%
The value of a flow, $|f|$, is defined as:
%%
\begin{align*}
	|f| = \sum_{v \in V} f(s,v) - \sum_{v \in V} f(v,s)
\end{align*}
%%
In the \textbf{maximum-flow} problem, we are given a flow network $G$ and we wish to find
a maximum flow.

Edges are anti-parallel if there is both an edge $(u,v)$ and an edge $(v,u)$. This is not allowed,
and to get around this we instead introduce a new edge $x$ and re-structure the edges as follows:
$(u,x), (x,v), (v,u)$. The capacity of the new edges involving $x$ is the same as the capacity from
$(u,v)$. See page 711 in the book for an example.

\subsection{Multiple sources and sinks}
%%
This can be accounted for by introducing a \textbf{supersink} and \textbf{supersource} with infinite
flow and capacity out to all of the sources and from all of the sinks to the supersink. See page 713.

\subsection{Ford-Fulkerson method}
%%
Three basic principles: \textbf{residual networks}, \textbf{augmenting paths} and \textbf{cuts}.
Essential for \textbf{max-flow min-cut} theorem (Theorem 26.6).

Intuition is as follows: We have a flow network $G$. We iteratively alter the flow of $G$, 
by finding an augmenting path in an associated residual network $G_f$. Once we know the edges
that belong to an augmenting path, we can identify specific edges in $G$ to increase or decrease
the flow of. Each iteration increases overall flow, but it may do so by decreasing the flow along
certain edges. This is repeated until the residual network $G_f$ has no more augmenting paths.

\textbf{max-flow min-cut} shows that upon termination, this yields a maximum flow.

\subsubsection{Residual network}
\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/augmenting_paths}
\end{figure}
%%
Given a network $G = (V,E)$ with a flow $f$, the \textbf{residual network}
of $G$ induced by $f$ is $G_f = (V, E_f)$, where
%%
\[
	E_f = \{(u,v) \in V \times V : c_f(u,v) > 0\}.
\]
%%
Residual capacity $c_f(u,v)$ is defined by
%%
\[
 c_f(u,v) =
  \begin{cases}
  	c(u,v) - f(u,v) & \text{if } (u,v) \in E, \\
  	f(v,u) & \text{if } (v,u) \in E, \\
  	0 & \text{otherwise}
  \end{cases}
\]
%%
\textit{Note:} that $(u,v) \in E$ implies $(v,u) \notin E$, so there is always only one of the three
above cases that applies. 

Because the edges in $E_f$ are either edges from $E$ or an edge in the opposite direction,
$|E_f| \leq 2|E|$.

Intuition: A residual network $G_f$ consists of edges with capacities that
represent how we can alter the flow on edges of $G$. $G$ can admit an
additional amount of flow along an edge, equal to the capacity minus the
current flow. If the edge can admit more flow, that edge is placed into $G_f$
with a value of $c_f(u,v) = c(u,v) - f(u,v)$. The residual network may also
contain edges that are not in $G$: In order to represent a possible decrease
of a flow $f(u,v)$ on an edge in $G$, we place an edge $(v,u)$ into $G_f$ with
residual capacity $c_f(v,u) = f(u,v)$. In other words, an edge that can admit
flow in the opposite direction, at most cancelling out flow entirely. See
Figure~\ref{fig:aug_paths} for an example.

Flows in a residual network satisfy the definition of a flow, but with respect to capacities
$c_f$ in the network $G_f$. If $f$ is a flow in $G$ and $f'$ is a flow in the corresponding residual
network $G_f$, we define $f \uparrow f'$, the \textbf{augmentation flow} of f by f', as a function
from $V \times V$ to $\mathbb{R}$ defined by
%%
\[
  (f \uparrow f')(u,v) =
  \begin{cases}
  	f(u,v) + f'(u,v) - f'(v,u) & \text{if } (u,v) \in E, \\
  	0 & \text{otherwise.}
  \end{cases}
\]

Intuition: Increase the flow ($f(u,v)$) by $f'(u,v)$, but decrease it by the flow in the
opposite direction ($f'(v,u)$). Pushing flow in the reverse direction is also called \textbf{cancellation}.

\subsubsection{Augmenting path}
An augmenting path $p$ is a simple path from $s$ to $t$ in the residual network $G_f$. By the definition
of a residual network, we may increase the flow of an edge $(u,v)$ by up to $c_f(u,v)$ without violating the
capacity constraint on whichever of $(u,v)$ and $(v,u)$ is in the original flow network $G$.

The maximum amount by which we can increase flow on each edge of an augmenting path $p$ is the
\textbf{residual capacity} of $p$, given by $c_f(p) = min\{c_f(u,v) : (u,v) \text{ is on p}\}$. More specifically,
if $p$ is an augmenting path in $G_f$, we define a function $f_p : V \times V \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ as
%%%
\[
	f_p(u,v) =
	\begin{cases}
		c_f(p) & \text{if } (u,v) \text{is on } p, \\
		0 & \text{otherwise}.
	\end{cases}
\]
%%
Then $f_p$ is a flow in $G_f$ with value $|f_p| = c_f(p) > 0$. See Lemma 26.2, page 720. It remains to be
shown that augmenting $f$ by $f_p$ produces a different flow in $G$ whose value is closer to the maximum.
Corollary 26.3 on page 720 shows this by immediate proof, using Lemma 26.1 and 26.2.

\subsubsection{Cuts of a network}
We know, based on the above, that we can augment flows in $G$ and that doing
so can produce a new flow closer to the maximum. But how do we know that when
it terminates, the algorithm has in fact found a maximum flow? Max-flow min-
cut tells us that a flow is maximum only if its residual network contains no
augmenting paths.

A \textbf{cut} $(S,T)$ of a flow network $G = (V,E)$ is a partition of $V$ into $S$ and $T=V-S$ such that
$s \in S$ and $t \in T$. If $f$ is a flow then the \textbf{net flow} $f(S,T)$ across the cut $(S,T)$ is
defined to be
%
\[
	f(S,T) = \sum_{u \in S} \sum_{v \in T} f(u,v) - 
	\sum_{u \in S} \sum_{v \in T} f(v,u)
\]
%
The \textbf{capacity} of the cut $(S,T)$ is
%
\[
	c(S,T) = \sum_{u \in S} \sum_{v \in T} c(u,v)
\]
%
Intuitively, the capacity of the cut is the capacity of all vertices going
from $S$ to $T$, while the flow is the flow of vertices going from $S$ to $T$,
minus the flow going from $T$ to $S$. A \textbf{minimum cut} of a network is a
cut whose capacity is minimum over all cuts of the network.

Theorem 26.6 (Max-flow min-cut theorem, p. 723/724) involves proving the equivalence of 3
different conditions:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item $f$ is a maximum flow of $G$. \label{max-min-theorem:1}
	\item The residual network $G_f$ contains no augmenting paths. \label{max-min-theorem:2}
	\item $|f| = c(S,T)$ for some cut $(S,T)$ of $G$. \label{max-min-theorem:3}
\end{enumerate}

\ref{max-min-theorem:1} => \ref{max-min-theorem:2}:
%
Assume that $f$ were a maximum flow in $G$ and there \textbf{was} an augmenting path. This
means, by the proof of augmenting paths, that we could create a new flow $f'$ in $G$ with a strictly
larger flow value than $f$, i.e. that $|f'| > |f|$. This contradicts $f$ being a maximum flow.

\ref{max-min-theorem:2} => \ref{max-min-theorem:3}:
%
Suppose that there are no augmenting paths, that is there is no path from $s$ to $t$ in $G_f$.

Define $S = \{v\in V: \text{there exists a path from $s$ to $v$ in $G_f$}\}$. That is, the set $S$
contains all those vertices for which there could be pushed more flow along, but which perhaps have
not because a later capacity limits that possibility. Define $T = V-S$. A partition $(S,T)$ is a cut,
where $s\in S$ and $t \notin S$ (since there is no path from $s$ to $t$, or we would not have a maximum
flow).

Consider two vertices $(u,v)$ where $u\in S$ and $v\in T$:

If $(u,v)\in E$, we must have that $f(u,v) = c(u,v)$. If this were not the case we would have 
$(u,v)\in E_f$, since we would be able to push more flow out until at capacity. Then, by the definition 
of $S$ we would have that $v\in S$. This is a contradiction.

If $(v,u)\in E$, we must have that $f(v,u) = 0$. If this were not the case we would have
$(v,u)\in E_f$, since the residual capacity $c_f(u,v) = f(v,u)$ would be positive. This
means $(u,v)\in E_f$, and we would have that $v\in S$. This is a contradiction.

Therefore:
\begin{align*}
	f(S,T) =& 	\sum_{u\in S}\sum_{v\in T} f(u,v) -
				\sum_{u\in S}\sum_{v\in T} f(v,u) \\
		   =&	\sum_{u\in S}\sum_{v\in T} c(u,v) -
		   		\sum_{u\in S}\sum_{v\in T} 0 \\
		   =&	c(S,T)
\end{align*}
%
\ref{max-min-theorem:3} => \ref{max-min-theorem:1}:
%
The value of \textbf{any} flow $f$ in a flow network $G$
is bounded from above by the capacity of \textbf{any} cut
of $G$. Proof:
\begin{align*}
	|f| =& f(S,T) \\
		=& \sum_{u\in S}\sum_{v\in T} f(u,v) -
			\sum_{u\in S}\sum_{v\in T} f(v,u) \\
		\leq& \sum_{u\in S}\sum_{v\in T} f(u,v) \\
		\leq& \sum_{u\in S}\sum_{v\in T} c(u,v) \\
		=& c(S,T)
\end{align*}

Because of this, $|f| \leq c(S,T)$ for \textbf{all} cuts
$(S,T)$. Therefore, $|f| = c(S,T)$ implies that $f$ is
a maximum flow.

				\State $(v,u).f = (v,u).f - c_f(p)$
			\EndIf
		\EndFor
	\EndWhile
\EndProcedure
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

Running time of the simple algorithm depends on how we find the augmenting path $p$.
If we assume an appropriate data structure where we can represent the directed graph,
the time to find an appropriate path can be linear in the number of edges, if using
breadth-first or depth-first search. 

This gives us $O(E)$ work per iteration of the while loop, and at most the same number of
iterations as the value of the maximum flow (since we increase by at least one unit per iteration).
The total running time is therefore $O(|f*| E)$, where $|f*|$ is the maximum flow.

\subsection{Edmonds-Karp}
Edmonds-Karp works by finding the shortest augmenting path each time. We choose the augmenting path
as a shortest path from $s$ to $t$ in the residual network, where each edge has unit distance (weight).
Edmonds-Karp runs in $O(VE^2)$ time. 

\textbf{(Lemma 26.7)}
If the Edmonds-Karp algorithm is run on a flow network $G = (V,E)$ with source $s$
and sink $t$, then for all vertices $v\in V - \{s,t\}$ the shortest-path distance $delta_f(s,v)$
in the residual network $G_f$ increases monotonically with each flow augmentation.

\textbf{(Theorem 26.8)}
If the Edmonds-Karp algorithm is run on a flow network $G = (V,E)$ with source $s$
and sink $t$, then the total number of flow augmentations performed by the algorithm
is $O(V E^2)$

Each iteration of Edmonds-Karp, at least one edge along the augmenting path is
a critical edge (an edge that bottlenecks the path, i.e.\ an edge that becomes
saturated). The main idea behind the theorem is to show that each edge can
become critical at most $|V|/2$ times. And since there are $O(E)$ pairs of
vertices that can have an edge between them in a residual network, the total
number of critical edges during the entire execution of Edmonds-Karp is
$O(VE)$.

Using breadth-first search to find an augmenting path in $O(E)$ time, this gives a total running
time of $O(V E^2)$.
